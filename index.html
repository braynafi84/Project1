  <p> My name is Nafissatou Bray. I am 34years old. I like art and craft.</p>        
 <p>  After graduating with a business degree, getting married all within a year time, 
 I started at a local bank as a  <span style = "background-color: lightblue;  border: thin solid darkblue;">Bank teller </span>. 
 After that, I worked  as a  <span style = "background-color: lightblue;  border: thin solid darkblue;">revenue cycle intern </span>.
 Later I decided to change a career and worked toward getting a degree in software engineering.
 I am a newbie in the field and I have a high motivation to develop many websites.
 <p>I really like to design <strong > websites online </strong> as a web developer. 
    I like to have some attainable challenges. I am currently learning a course on the basics of understanding HTML. I spend most
    of my time learning full stack engineering courses online.
   I also like to code and deliver good web apps</p>
 Without a doubt, it was my hard work and desire to excel that got me to a great start a career in software development.
 With positive vision and courage that moved me up everyday. 
 Today, I hope with my warmth and passion to be a valuable resource to the company I will be working and to all those around him.
  With an extensive experiences in management. I hope both skills can help me land a job as a software developer </p>
